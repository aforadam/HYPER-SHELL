    "readme": "# hyper-drop-file\n\nThe hyper plugin to let you drop file path into your terminal\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nhyper install hyper-drop-file\n```\nFor the first time use, _YOU NEED TO RESTART_ your hyper terminal.\n\n![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qweasd1/hyper-drop-file/master/hyper_drop_file.gif)\n\n\n## Customization\n\n### Customize the path rewrite logic\nOn different platform (windows, mac and linux) the path when dropped will be consistent to the platform.\nHowever, on windows, someone want to linux shell and don't want the path to be windows style path. You can\ncustomize this by add hyperDropFile configuration to ```.hyper.js```\nHere is one sample:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  config: {\n    ...\n    // add this and change the logic inside pathRewriter function. The return string will be the rewrite path \n    hyperDropFile:{\n      pathRewriter:(path,hyperConfig)=>{\n         return path + \"$\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n  },\n\n  ...\n};\n\n```\n\nThe first parameter ```path``` is the original path of dropped file and the second parameter ```hyperConfig``` is hyper config object from ```hyper.js``` (value return by calling ```config.getConfig()```).\nThis can give you more context information you can customize. For instance, you can use ```hyperConfig.shell``` to read what shell is currently running inside hyper terminal and change the path rewrite logic.\n\n\n\nThe default path rewrite logic of this plugin is to escape whitespace when drop the filepath. If you define you \nown ```pathRewriter()``` it will *OVERRIDE* the default rewrite to escape whitespace, so do add this logic to your own pathRewriter.\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n",
